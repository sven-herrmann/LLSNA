# LLSNA

Project to keep my progress for the course low-level and semi-numeric algorithms.

Implemented thus far:
  - a prime test with O(1) for n less or equal to 64
  - a fast popcnt implementation (num_set_bits)
  - fast lexicographic subset:
    - ordered by the binary word representing the set
    - ordered by the set itself
  - fast integer composition (sum_composition)
  - fast integer partition (sum_partition)
  - fast set_partitions
